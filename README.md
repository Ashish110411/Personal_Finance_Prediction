# Indian Household Wealth Predictor

This project implements a machine learning-based system to predict whether an individual from an Indian household will be considered wealthy by the age of 60 and estimate their projected wealth using financial behavior data.

## Objective

To apply classification and regression models on synthetic Indian household data and analyze how income, expenses, and saving patterns contribute to long-term wealth accumulation.

## Features Engineered

- `Monthly_Savings`: Income minus total expenses
- `Savings_Rate`: Monthly savings divided by income
- `Projected_Wealth`: Estimated wealth at age 60 (without compounding)
- `Wealthy_By_60`: Binary label for classification (based on a specified wealth threshold)

## Models Implemented

### Classification
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier  

### Regression
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  

## Key Insights

- Engineered features like savings rate and monthly savings proved to be strong indicators of financial success.
- Models effectively distinguished between high savers and low savers across income brackets.
- Classification and regression approaches complemented each other to give both binary decisions and numerical forecasts.

## Visualizations

- Confusion matrices comparing classifier performance
- Residual and prediction plots for regression models
- Comparison of MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² scores across regressors

## How to Run

1. Upload the `data.csv` file in a Jupyter or Google Colab environment.
2. Open `Personal_Finance_Management_and_Wealth_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_for_Indian_Households.ipynb`.
3. Execute all cells in order to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results.
4. Modify model parameters or threshold values as needed.
